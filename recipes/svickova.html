    <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <h3>What meat to use for the creamed sirloin?</h3>
        <p>Before we dive into the sirloin sauce here, we should ask ourselves what is actually the most suitable meat for sirloin? If you want to be a real foodie and splurge financially, reach for a real sirloin. But for more sensible and economical cooking, you can get by just fine with beef butt or round shoulder. The meat will be beautifully tender.</p>

        <h3>Preparing the meat</h3>
        <p>Pat the meat dry, season with salt and go for the spicing. If you're not quite confident in your kramfels and don't have the sharpest knife, I recommend letting the meat set in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before spicing. It will be much friendlier to work with.</p>

        <p>Somewhere within easy reach, prepare approximately 1cm wide bacon rashers and get going. Prick the meat and insert the bacon into the resulting holes.</p>

        <p>Clean the root vegetables and cut them into larger slices. Dice the onion and move on.</p>

        <h3>We are going to roast</h3>
        <p>Melt the butter in a pan or, better still, in a roasting tin and let the meat brown. We want to preserve as much juice as possible. Once the meat is browned on all sides, remove it from the stock and add another tablespoon of butter to the stock.</p>

        <p>Then fry the onions together with the root vegetables. A medium flame is ideal and sauté until golden brown. The vegetables will caramelise beautifully and give the whole sauce a wonderful flavour.
        Add the meat to the vegetables, add the thyme, rub the meat with mustard and add allspice, bay leaf, peppercorns and also a quarter of a lemon whole and pour in the stock. If you want a really perfect sirloin, let it marinate like this somewhere cool with the lid on for at least 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <p>Bake the sirloin in the oven for approximately 2 hours at 180 °C in a covered baking dish.</p>

        <p>If you love pappini, you can speed up the whole process with the meat and vegetables in the pappini maker by simply letting the meat and vegetables cook for about 30 minutes (it depends on your machine - everyone works a little differently and at different speeds).</p>

        <h3>Finishing the sauce</h3>
        <p>The meat is soft, the vegetables too. So now to the highlight of the whole meal - the sauce.</p>

        <p>Set the meat and lemon aside. We won't be needing the lemon, so feel free to throw it away. Then blend the vegetables with the spices until smooth. Strain it through a colander so that there are no unnecessary and unpleasant pieces of spices, and finally, soften the sauce with cooking cream and also a spoonful of caramel. Taste. Is it delicious? Great!</p>

        <p>Of course, the creamed candle tastes best with dumplings and cranberry jam.</p>
